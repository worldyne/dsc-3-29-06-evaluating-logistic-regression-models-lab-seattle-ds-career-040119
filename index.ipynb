    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw with KNN, we need alternative evaluation metrics to determine the effectiveness of classification algorithms. In regression, we were predicting values so it made sense to discuss error as a distance of how far off our estimates were. In classifying a binary variable however, we are either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to deconstruct this as how many false positives versus false negatives we come across.  \n",
    "In particular, we examine a few different specific measurements when evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. In this review lab, we'll review precision, recall and accuracy in order to evaluate our logistic regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:  \n",
    "* Understand and assess precision recall and accuracy of classifiers\n",
    "* Evaluate classification models using various metrics\n",

    "At times, we may wish to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precison or recall rather then overall accuracy. For example, imagine the scenario of predicting whether or not a patient is at risk for cancer and should be brought in for additional testing. In cases such as this, we often may want to cast a slightly wider net, and it is much preferable to optimize for recall, the number of cancer positive cases, then it is to optimize precision, the percentage of our predicted cancer-risk patients who are indeed positive."

    "Nice! In this lab, you gained some extra practice with evaluation metrics for classification algorithms. You also got some further python practice by manually coding these functions yourself, giving you a deeper understanding of how they work. Going forward, continue to think about scenarios in which you might prefer to optimize one of these metrics over another."
